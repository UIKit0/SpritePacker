{"name":"Spritepacker","tagline":"Small utility for converting gifs and image sequences into sprite atlases.","body":"### It is this\r\nI created SpritePacker to be able to easily convert GIF animations to PNG sprite atlases to easily import and use them in Unity.\r\n\r\n### Download\r\n\r\n[Please, find all SpritePacker releases here.](https://github.com/martincohen/SpritePacker/releases)\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n* Sprite atlas from a single GIFs\r\n* Compound sprite from multiple GIFs\r\n* Keep the folder structure.\r\n\r\n### Planned features\r\n\r\n* Add a single image to the sprite atlas (now possible with a single-frame gif only).\r\n* Keep the ordering of the GIFs in the sprite atlas (now only keeps the files sorted alphabetically)\r\n* Allow use of image sequences.\r\n* SpritePacker does not currently support combining various frame sizes in a compound sprite atlas. (The size of the frame for resulting atlas is taken from the very first processed animation).\r\n* Mac/Linux (just needs compiling for these platforms)\r\n\r\n\r\nShould you have any more suggestions or will find any bugs, [please enter them to the issue tracker.](https://github.com/martincohen/SpritePacker/issues).\r\n\r\n### How it works\r\n\r\nCreate a folder where you will export GIFs, images and image sequences from your favorite editor. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\tSprites\r\n\t\tBarry\r\n\t\t\tBarry-Run.gif\r\n\t\t\tBarry-Idle.gif\r\n\t\t\tBarry-Attack.compound\r\n\t\t\t\tBarry-Attack-Mace.gif\r\n\t\t\t\tBarry-Attack-Sword.gif\r\n\t\t\t\tBarry-Attack-Chair.gif\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun the SpritePacker and pass it the root of the Sprites directory: `SpritePacker.exe Sprites`. SpritePacker will generate a subdirectory called `.package` where the result will be generated. Note: Files and repositories prefixed with `.` (dot) are ignored, so the `.package` directory will be ignored at the next run.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\tSprites\r\n\t\t.package\r\n\t\t\tBarry\r\n\t\t\t\tBarry-Run.png\r\n\t\t\t\tBarry-Idle.png\r\n\t\t\t\tBarry-Attack.png\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpritePacker generated `Barry-Run.png` and `Barry-Idle.png` from the single GIFs (`Barry-Run.gif` and `Barry-Idle.gif` respectively), but made one large PNG file from all the attacks. That's because those were stored in a directory with `.compound` suffix.\r\n\r\nSpritePacker also kept the directory structure the same as was the input.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
